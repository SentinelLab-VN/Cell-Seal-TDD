  - title: Sealed
    details: Every amount on chain is a Pedersen commitment, not a readable number. Addresses, timestamps and order references stay public.
  - title: Proven
    details: Every transaction carries an UltraHonk proof of conservation, range and policy, verified on Soroban. The chain rejects a wrong number without reading it.
  - title: Disclosed
    details: The viewing key is split k-of-n between issuer, transfer agent and regulator. They rebuild 100% of the register. Cell Seal holds no key.
